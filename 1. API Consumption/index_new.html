            <p>
                Cannellini Beans are white kidney beans, also known as Italian white kidney beans or fasolia beans. They are medium sized--about 1/2 inch long and kidney shaped, with a tough seed coat. This specific variety is very popular in Italian cuisine, appearing dishes such as minestrone, pasta e fagioli soup and the common stewed bean side dish with garlic and rosemary.

            <p>
                This bean was originally cultivated in Argentina by Italian immigrants and was later taken back to Italy, where they are now grown commercially.

                Cannellini Beans are members of the larger family of legumes, plants used for their edible seeds and pods that boast a high nutrient density with low-maintenance production and storage. They contain high levels of protein, essential minerals and fiber while maintaining a low level of fats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Believed to have originated in Peru, beans were spread through trade throughout South and Central America, later being introduced to Europe in the 15th century by Spanish explorers. Known as a high-quality, inexpensive source of protein and nutrition, they have become diet staples in many cultures and are now widely produced in Asia, Europe and North America.
