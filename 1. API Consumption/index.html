            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Cannellini Beans are white kidney beans, also known as Italian white kidney beans or fasolia beans. They are medium sized--about 1/2 inch long and kidney shaped, with a tough seed coat. This specific variety is very popular in Italian cuisine, appearing dishes such as minestrone, pasta e fagioli soup and the common stewed bean side dish with garlic and rosemary.
            </p>
            <p>
                This bean was originally cultivated in Argentina by Italian immigrants and was later taken back to Italy, where they are now grown commercially.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cannellini Beans are members of the larger family of legumes, plants used for their edible seeds and pods that boast a high nutrient density with low-maintenance production and storage. They contain high levels of protein, essential minerals and fiber while maintaining a low level of fats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Believed to have originated in Peru, beans were spread through trade throughout South and Central America, later being introduced to Europe in the 15th century by Spanish explorers. Known as a high-quality, inexpensive source of protein and nutrition, they have become diet staples in many cultures and are now widely produced in Asia, Europe and North America.
